      <p>OpenRISC is an open ISA that has been around for twenty years now. It has a very open, friendly community around hobbyists and has seen some commercial adoption. There is one well-maintained reference open source implementation, <a href="https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx">mor1kx</a>, and the community is constantly working on getting all tools upstream and keep them updated.</p>

      <p>The OpenRISC has been the incubator for <a href="https://orconf.org">ORConf (the largest open source digital design conference)</a>, <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org">FOSSi Foundation (a non-profit foundation that supports the open source silicon community)</a>, and <a href="https://librecores.org">librecores.org (a community hub for open source silicon IP)</a>.</p>

      <p>Alternatives exists, open and proprietary, and you should obviously decide which ISA fits your needs. You also can have more than one favorite ISA.</p>
